    "Constructing a Classical Shadow\n",
    "===============================\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical shadow estimation relies on the fact that for a particular\n",
    "choice of measurement, we can efficiently store snapshots of the state\n",
    "that contain enough information to accurately predict linear functions\n",
    "of observables. Depending on what type of measurements we choose, we\n",
    "have an information-theoretic bound that allows us to control the\n",
    "precision of our estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider an $n$-qubit quantum state $\\rho$ (prepared by a\n",
    "circuit) and apply a random unitary $U$ to the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho \\to U \\rho U^\\dagger.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we measure in the computational basis and obtain a bit string of\n",
    "outcomes $|b\\rangle = |0011\\ldots10\\rangle$. If the unitaries $U$ are\n",
    "chosen at random from a particular ensemble, then we can store the\n",
    "reverse operation $U^\\dagger |b\\rangle\\langle b| U$ efficiently in\n",
    "classical memory. We call this a *snapshot* of the state. Moreover, we\n",
    "can view the average over these snapshots as a measurement channel:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[U^\\dagger |b\\rangle\\langle b| U\\right] = \\mathcal{M}(\\rho).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the ensemble of unitaries defines a tomographically complete set of\n",
    "measurements, we can invert the channel and reconstruct the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathcal{M}^{-1}\\left(U^\\dagger |b\\rangle\\langle b| U \\right)\\right].$$\n",
